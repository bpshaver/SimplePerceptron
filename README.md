# SimplePerceptron
My implementation of a simple perceptron learning rule.

Python Machine Learning (Sebastian Raschka) Chapter 2 describes the simple Perceptron learning rule. To test my understanding, I implemented the algorithm in Python. As of this writing, I'm a new Python user, so this represents a rough draft. 

Potential improvements would include re-writing all functions as methods of a "Perceptron" class, allowing for more than two feature variables by implementing multiplication, and generally inspecting the code for speed and efficiency.
