# SimplePerceptron
My implementation of a simple perceptron learning algorithm.

Chapter 2, Python Machine Learning - Sebastian Raschka describes the simple Perceptron learning algorithm. To test my understanding, I implemented the algorithm in Python. As of this writing, I'm a new Python user, so this represents a rough draft. 

Potential improvements would include re-writing all functions as methods of a "Perceptron" class, allowing for more than two feature variables by implementing generalized matrix multiplication, and generally inspecting the code for speed and efficiency.
